Project Overview
Summary of the Project
This project involves creating a simple Store Application in C++ that reads words from a file and allows the user to view the frequency of each word. The application solves the problem of quickly analyzing the content of a text file by counting the occurrences of each word and presenting the results in both text and histogram formats. This kind of utility can be especially useful for tasks like text analysis or preparing data for further processing.

What Was Done Well
One of the strengths of this project is the clear structure and logical flow of the code. The main program is easy to understand, with a loop that continuously interacts with the user until they decide to quit. The use of modular programming by encapsulating functionality within the Store class ensures that the code is organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

Areas for Enhancement
There are a few areas where the code could be enhanced:

Efficiency: Currently, the program reads the input file and processes it every time it runs. This could be optimized by checking if the file has been updated since the last run and only reprocessing it if necessary. This would save time, especially with larger files.

Security: The code doesn't currently handle potential issues such as malformed input files or exceptions that could arise from file I/O operations. Adding proper error handling would make the application more robust.

Code Optimization: The histogram printing method could be optimized by precomputing the longest word and adjusting the format dynamically. This would make the output more readable, especially for large datasets.

Challenges Faced
One of the more challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the word frequency counting was done efficiently. Handling edge cases, such as words with punctuation or different cases (e.g., "Word" vs. "word"), required careful consideration. I overcame these challenges by researching best practices in text processing and applying those principles in the code.

To support myself during the development process, I utilized resources like online C++ documentation, coding forums, and example projects to guide my approach. I also found debugging tools within my development environment invaluable for tracking down and fixing issues.

Transferable Skills
This project honed several key skills that will be transferable to other projects:

File I/O Operations: Managing files, reading from them, and writing output in a structured way is a fundamental skill in many programming tasks.

Data Structures: The use of maps to store and manipulate word frequencies provided practical experience with associative containers, which are crucial for efficient data management.

Modular Programming: Breaking down the problem into a Store class and separate methods improved my ability to design and implement modular, reusable code.

Maintainability and Readability
To ensure that the program is maintainable and adaptable, I focused on:

Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions: I used descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables, making the code easier to understand at a glance.

Modular Code Design: By encapsulating functionality within the Store class, I made it easier to manage the code and allowed for future expansions, such as adding more complex data processing or additional user options.

Comments and Documentation: The code is well-documented, with comments explaining the purpose of each section, making it easier for others (or myself in the future) to pick up and work on the code.

This project has been a valuable learning experience, and the skills and practices developed here will undoubtedly contribute to future programming endeavors.
